## Design patterns module

### Creational

`Factory` "Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to sub-classes." (GOF)

`Abstract Factory` "Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects 
without specifying their concrete classes." (GOF)

`Builder` "Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that 
the same construction process can create different representations." (GOF)

`Prototype` "Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype." (GOF)

`Singleton` "Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it." (GOF)

### Structural

`Adapter` "Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces." (GOF)

`Bridge`"Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently." (GOF)

`Composite`"Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly." (GOF)

`Decorator` "Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality." (GOF)
